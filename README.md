- ðŸ˜Ž Hi, my name is Matt. My background is in agricultural research. 
- My day job is in the lab, but I spend my free time learning new skills and exploring offshoots of my research. Right now that means exploring the effect of technology and innovation on life science markets - mainly agricultural biotech. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning R, linear algebra, and econometrics.
